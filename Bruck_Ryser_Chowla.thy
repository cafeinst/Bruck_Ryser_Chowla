section ‹Bruck Ryser Chowla Theorem›
text ‹The Bruck Ryser Chowla Theorem states the following:
Let $(v,k,\Lambda)$ be a symmetric BIBD. If v is even, 
then $k-\Lambda$ will be a perfect square. And if v is odd,
then there will exist integers $(x,y,z) \neq (0,0,0)$ such that
$x^2 = (k-Λ) y^2 = (-1)^{(v-1)/2}Λz^2$. The proof comes from 
"Combinatorial Designs: Constructions and Analysis" by Douglas R.
